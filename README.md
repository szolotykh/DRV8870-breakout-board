## Examples

Here are example Arduino sketches that demonstrate how to control a DC motor using the DRV8870 Motor Controller

### PWM Control

```Arduino
// define the motor control pins
int in1Pin = 2;
int in2Pin = 3;

void setup() {
// set the motor control pins as outputs
pinMode(in1Pin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(in2Pin, OUTPUT);

// set the motor speed to half of the maximum
int speed = 127;

// set the direction to forward
digitalWrite(in1Pin, HIGH);
digitalWrite(in2Pin, LOW);

// apply the PWM signal to the EN pin
analogWrite(enPin, speed);
}

void loop() {
// do nothing
}
```
